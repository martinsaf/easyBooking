# easyBooking
This project is a Node.js-based API for managing bookings. It allows users to create, update, retrieve and delete amenities, bookings, hosts, properties, reviews and users. The API leverages Prisma as the ORM to handle database interactions, supporting complex relationships like many-to-many connections between properties and amenities.
